# Fallback Image Required

**Important:** You need to add a `fallback.jpg` file to this `docs/` directory.

This fallback image will be displayed when album cover images fail to load from external URLs.

## Requirements:
- File name: `fallback.jpg`
- Location: `docs/fallback.jpg`
- Recommended size: 400x400 pixels
- Format: JPEG

The application will automatically use this image when the original album cover fails to load.
